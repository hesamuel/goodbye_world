We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",

I told her that I didn\\'t really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then.

       "     'selftext': 'A bit of context. I\\'m an American. I\\'m black. I\\'m big. I\\'m ugly. And I\\'m autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.\\n\\nThe more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who\\'s gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they\\'re being funny, but they\\'re being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.\\n\\nBesides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.\\n\\nPeople cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn\\'t like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won\\'t ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I\\'m likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I\\'ve been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every \"random\" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.\\n\\nThat being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I\\'m also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I\\'m questioning more and more why I care. More money isn\\'t going to fix me as a person.\\n\\nThe truth is, I\\'m a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was.

And I&amp;#39;m autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who&amp;#39;s gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they&amp;#39;re being funny, but they&amp;#39;re being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn&amp;#39;t like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won&amp;#39;t ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I&amp;#39;m likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I&amp;#39;ve been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I&amp;#39;m also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I&amp;#39;m questioning more and more why I care. More money isn&amp;#39;t going to fix me as a person.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I&amp;#39;m a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should&amp;#39;ve been aborted or left to die.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don&amp;#39;t give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before long, I will have a gun.

I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I&amp;#39;m gay, came out, and I&amp;#39;m with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn&amp;#39;t kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don&amp;#39;t know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there. But you need to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.\\nOkay so im 22 M I guess I\\'ve been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I\\'m self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it\\'s okay here I\\'d like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.\\nI was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You\\'d have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That\\'s the first few years of life. I ran around as a \"happy\" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone\\'s emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I\\'m struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let\\'s continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to \"protect\" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted \"who I was\" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn\\'t touch anyone with out them screaming \"DONT TOUCH ME GERM\" \"GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF\" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn\\'t even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn\\'t back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn\\'t bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I\\'m greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) \"You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak\". I can\\'t tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me \"mysteriouslyreddited\". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn\\'s amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn\\'t seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don\\'t remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I\\'ve ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn\\'t stand up for myself or tell myself it\\'s okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that\\'s how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven\\'t reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that\\'s false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn\\'t been on one in years and I\\'d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I\\'d pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell \"get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!\". I replied with \"well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you\\'re ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are\" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother\\'s husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I\\'d had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I\\'d seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and \"ignored\" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you\\'d find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don\\'t remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I\\'ve had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I\\'m worried that I won\\'t be able to win. I don\\'t recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I\\'ve become. I love my GF but I feel like I\\'m going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I\\'m not good enough for her and I\\'m hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I\\'ve talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I\\'m not looking for a way to leave her. I\\'ve been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there\\'s no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I\\'m not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release. Next therapy session will hopefully straighten up my current state of mind',\n",

The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted &amp;quot;who I was&amp;quot; and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn&amp;#39;t touch anyone with out them screaming &amp;quot;DONT TOUCH ME GERM&amp;quot; &amp;quot;GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF&amp;quot; and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn&amp;#39;t even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn&amp;#39;t back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn&amp;#39;t bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I&amp;#39;m greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) &amp;quot;You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak&amp;quot;. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me &amp;quot;mysteriouslyreddited&amp;quot;. I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn&amp;#39;s amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn&amp;#39;t seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don&amp;#39;t remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I&amp;#39;ve ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn&amp;#39;t stand up for myself or tell myself it&amp;#39;s okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that&amp;#39;s how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven&amp;#39;t reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that&amp;#39;s false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn&amp;#39;t been on one in years and I&amp;#39;d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I&amp;#39;d pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell &amp;quot;get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!&amp;quot;. I replied with &amp;quot;well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you&amp;#39;re ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are&amp;quot; and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother&amp;#39;s husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I&amp;#39;d had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I&amp;#39;d seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and &amp;quot;ignored&amp;quot; her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you&amp;#39;d find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don&amp;#39;t remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I&amp;#39;ve had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I&amp;#39;m worried that I won&amp;#39;t be able to win. I don&amp;#39;t recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I&amp;#39;ve become. I love my GF but I feel like I&amp;#39;m going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I&amp;#39;m not good enough for her and I&amp;#39;m hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I&amp;#39;ve talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I&amp;#39;m not looking for a way to leave her. I&amp;#39;ve been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there&amp;#39;s no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I&amp;#39;m not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release. Next therapy session will hopefully straighten up my current state of mind&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLetter to my depressed lover.\\n\\nI see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt\\n\\ndeserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless\\n\\nbasement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at\\n\\ntimes it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your\\n\\nbody, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight\\n\\nthis mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel\\n\\nthe sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love\\n\\nagain?\\n\\nWhy are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.\\n\\nA tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not\\n\\nunderstanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but\\n\\nto succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no\\n\\nlonger a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too\\n\\nmighty to outthink, too present to escape.\\n\\nBut let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.\\n\\nBehind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a\\n\\nheart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to\\n\\nsee the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,\\n\\nbecause love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.\\n\\nBut how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves\\n\\nthe way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with\\n\\nblood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the\\n\\npoint of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of\\n\\ndarkness?\\n\\nNo. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that\\n\\nyour love is strong enough to turn him around.\\n\\nThe man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the\\n\\nsight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is\\n\\nsurprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The\\n\\nman that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around\\n\\nhim feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you\\n\\nnever knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I\\n\\nlove will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and\\n\\nattention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that\\n\\nhe can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,\\n\\nit will be the man that I love.\\n\\nLove can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,\\n\\ncomfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,\\n\\nwith a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\ntyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all\\n\\nalong he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were\\n\\nnever your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that\\n\\nrealisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are\\n\\nfacing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he\\n\\nwon’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will\\n\\nrealise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your\\n\\ntyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who\\n\\ndoesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man\\n\\nwho can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.\\n\\nSo you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s\\n\\nto say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that\\n\\nhe is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The\\n\\nchild will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,\\n\\nhe is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.\\n\\nYou will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will\\n\\nfeel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel\\n\\nblinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to\\n\\nlook after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But\\n\\nyou will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the\\n\\ncool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,\\n\\ncarry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step\\n\\nmight be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get\\n\\nback up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.\\n\\nEventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first\\n\\ncame out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.\\n\\nOn your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a\\n\\nburden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a\\n\\ntyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone\\n\\nfor so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone\\n\\nelse? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been\\n\\nhurt?\\n\\nBut all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you\\n\\ndisappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to\\n\\nfind you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I\\n\\nsearched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,\\n\\nit only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was\\n\\nleft weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.\\n\\nSo I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be\\n\\nable to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our\\n\\nspace so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could\\n\\none day feel whole again and heal.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I\\n\\nlearned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already\\n\\nknow your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You\\n\\nalso know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.\\n\\nShe has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was\\n\\nafraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When\\n\\nyou were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never\\n\\ncome back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you\\n\\nwanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.\\n\\nBut I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we\\n\\nspent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,\\n\\nand we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve\\n\\never known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,\\n\\nnever just goes away.\\n\\nOne day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we\\n\\nlove each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced\\n\\nby trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant\\n\\nmemory.\\n\\nThis isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come\\n\\nhome, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so\\n\\nthat you can slowly but surely come back to us.\\n\\nIf I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force\\n\\nmyself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will\\n\\ncollapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I\\n\\nam still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant\\n\\nunconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he\\n\\ncan learn to fearlessly trust both of us.',\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Letter to my depressed lover.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;again?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;mighty to outthink, too present to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;darkness?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;your love is strong enough to turn him around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;it will be the man that I love.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;hurt?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;one day feel whole again and heal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;come back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;spent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;ever known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;never just goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;memory.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;that you can slowly but surely come back to us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       " 'selftext': 'We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \\n\\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",
